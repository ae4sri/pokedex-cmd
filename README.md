# pokedex-cmd
Object-oriented pokedex app built in Java, with unit tests in JUnit 5.

## About

This is the command line version of another Java program I created, linked here: https://github.com/ae4sri/pokedex-fx. It's a Poxedex available through your command line;
generic and individual Pokemon are able to be added and viewed, as well as moves and teams. The program has an object-oriented structure; object definitions can be viewed in /src/pokedex/pokemon.

## How to Run

I would reccomend just running the program through your IDE. Only internal Java libraries are used (except for JUnit for testing) so the program shouldn't be 
too difficult to configure. The Main class
is pokedex.Main.
